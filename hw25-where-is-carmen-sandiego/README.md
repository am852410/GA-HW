![carmen-sandiego](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b50a6155810da803a9b420ae0bd403317afd341d/687474703a2f2f692e67697068792e636f6d2f31336e38747852386339554448472e676966)


We're going to use what we've already learned about searching with SQL commands and apply it to chase down and capture an elusive and world-renowned thief: Carmen Sandiego. Follow the clues, use the interweb, write down both the SQL commands/queries you used and your answers to the clues, and figure out where Carmen is headed so we can catch her.

## Setup

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Go inside the folder you just cloned
- From your terminal we will create a database called `carmen` and populate it with the data found in `world.sql`. The only thing you have to do is to run the command in your terminal.
```sh
$: psql -f world.sql
```

You should see something like this. :point_down:

Now your database is ready!!!! good luck detective :shipit: :mag: 

## Exercise

- On the file [find_carmen.sql](find_carmen.sql) use the clues to create the appropriate SQL queries to help you find Carmen. Tell us where she's heading!
- You can run your queries on the terminal or in pgAdmin, just save the final query to the file and move to the next clue.
- For each clue solved do a commit :wink:
- Create a pull request to submit your work.
